The seats should be replaced and one of the walls needs to be re-affixed to the door before it hurts someone, there are screws sticking out and easily accessible in a space frequented by children.\",\n",

       " \"Everyone knows that this place has subpar pizza but sometimes as parents we look past that because of the cheap price.  My biggest gripes are that they don't take responsibility for everything in their building.  Something as simple as the token machine they have.  They have a token machine to buy tokens.  One would think that the video games they have there would run off those tokens.  But when you finally approach the video games they don't run off of tokens but you have to buy a card and charge it to play video games.  I approached the manager about getting a refund.  I would take that refund and then buy the video game cards.  But all I got was the answer that those are n ot owned by cities.  We don't take responsibility for the video games since it is an outside company that runs and owns them.  How difficult would it be for them to give me my refund or whoever this happens to and then them work out all the refunds they had to give with that company that they allow to bring in video games to their restaurant?  Instead they would rather let this lose them business.  What this type of thing does is create a ton of one time customers.  It definitely does not create repeat customers.\",\n",

I do have to say that back in the day they did not have pasta and the salad bar was not as extensive as it is now. I enjoyed every minute of reliving the nostalgia of my college years. The manager that was working was fantastic and really nice. She made my favorite pizza which is the barbecue beef pizza and I enjoyed it thoroughly. What a wonderful experience and a very clean and nice restaurant.',\n",

I had a bowl of soup and a salad while I waited, the soup was hot and the salad was fresh and cold, worth the price right there. Watching the crew work, they were engaged, positive and busy. The manager brought out the anchovy pizza and it was amazing, hot, fresh, and delicious. It had been awhile since we had been there but already planning out next trip\",\n",
